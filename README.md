# Real Estate House Price Predictor 🏡📊

A machine learning–based web application built with **Streamlit**, **Python**, and **scikit-learn** that predicts real estate prices based on key property features. This app allows users to input details like *location*, *total square feet*, *number of bedrooms (BHK)*, and *bathrooms* to get an estimated price using a trained regression model. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow:

- **Data Exploration & Cleaning** — Preprocessing the Bangalore house prices dataset.
- **Model Training** — Building a regression model to learn price patterns.
- **Model Persistence** — Saving the trained model and feature encodings for reuse.
- **Web Interface** — Using Streamlit to build an interactive UI for real-time predictions. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
